This repository stores all image assets for the apps from MartinMeel Umbrel App Store.
  
  Each app from the store has its own folder.
  Inside every folder, you’ll find:

  - icon.svg → the app icon used in the Umbrel App Store
  - 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, ... → gallery images
  
All assets were previously hosted on Imgur and will now be stored within this repository for better reliability and long-term availability.
  
Additionally, all images follow Umbrel’s official app store guidelines regarding format, resolution, and naming conventions to ensure a consistent visual experience across the store. New assets are continuously added and updated as apps evolve or receive visual refreshes.
